# IB DP CompSci - First Class Exercise: Data Types

# For each variable below, write a comment with what kind of thing it is (int, float, str, or bool)
number = 7
decimal = 3.5
word = "hello"
is_sunny = True
print(type(number))
print(type(decimal))
print(type(word))
print(type(is_sunny))

# Change the values to the type shown in the comment?
age = "15"      # Change to int
score = 10      # Change to str
rain = "False"  # Change to bool
height = "1.75" # Change to float
print(type(age))
print(type(score))
print(type(rain))
print(type(height))

# What will be printed?
print(type(2 + 2))
print(type("5" + "5"))
print(type(3.0 + 1))
print(type(True))
# Write your guesses as comments, then run and check
